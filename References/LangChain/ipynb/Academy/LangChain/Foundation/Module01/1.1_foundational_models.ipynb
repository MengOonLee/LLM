            "| **Location** | Near the northern pole of the Moon, at a stable, sun‑lit crater rim (≈ 5 km radius). The site was chosen for its permanently shadowed water‑ice deposits and for the thin, stable “lunar sky” that lets Earth‑view telescopes peer directly to Earth. |\n",
            "| **Founding Year** | 2067 CE (Lunar Calendar Year 42). It was the result of a joint program between the United Nations Space Agency (UNSA), the European Lunar Federation (ELF), and the United States Lunar Initiative (USLI). |\n",
            "| **Population (2025)** | 12,400 residents – a mix of scientists, engineers, diplomats, and a small civilian community. 45 % of the residents are on temporary, 5‑year lunar contracts; the rest hold permanent lunar citizenship. |\n",
            "| **Governance** | • **Lunar Constitutional Council** – elected by residents and representatives of the Earth‑based partner agencies. <br>• **Mayor‑Chief of Safety** – oversees day‑to‑day operations, emergency protocols, and inter‑agency coordination. <br>• **Lunar Charter** – a living document that adapts to new discoveries, built on principles of sustainability, scientific freedom, and international cooperation. |\n",
            "| **Infrastructure** |\n",
            "| • **Habitat Modules** | Modular, inflatable “Bioshell” habitats using regolith‑based composites to provide radiation shielding and thermal stability. Each module supports 12–15 residents. |\n",
            "| • **Solar Array Complex** | 10 MW peak output; arrays are mounted on a rotating “solar sail” that tracks the Sun as the Moon rotates (≈ 27.3 days). Energy is stored in high‑capacity lithium‑sulfur batteries. |\n",
            "| • **Water Extraction Plant** | Uses cryogenic processing to pull water ice from permanently shadowed craters and return it as potable water, hydroponics supply, and for electrolysis (oxygen and hydrogen for propellant). |\n",
            "| • **Research Laboratories** | 3 major facilities: (1) **Lunar Materials Lab** – studies regolith, ices, and potential in‑situ resource utilization (ISRU). (2) **Astrobiology Hub** – examines extremophiles, panspermia models, and in‑situ life‑detection instruments. (3) **Space Engineering Center** – focuses on propulsion, habitat design, and low‑gravity robotics. |\n",
            "| • **Transportation** | • **Lunar Lander Fleet** – eight reusable landers for crew and cargo transport. <br>• **Lunar Rover Network** – autonomous rovers equipped with AI for scientific surveying and EVA support. <br>• **Orbital Logistics Hub** – at the nearby Lagrange‑point 1 (L1) station, acting as a staging area for Earth‑to‑Moon cargo flights. |\n",
            "| • **Communications** | Deep‑space antenna array in the southern lunar hemisphere provides constant 5‑G and laser‑communication links to Earth. |\n",
            "| • **Medical Center** | 100-bed facility with telemedicine links to world‑class Earth hospitals. |\n",
            "| • **Cultural Center** | The “Moonlight Pavilion” hosts art, theater, and a public observatory for Earth‑sky watching. |\n",
            "| **Economy** | • **Research Grants** – major funding source; international agencies fund experiments. <br>• **ISRU Products** – oxygen, regolith composites, and hydrogen fuel marketed to visiting spacecraft. <br>• **Tourism** – a small but growing sector offering “lunar experience” packages to affluent Earth‑tourists (since 2082). |\n",
            "| **Challenges & Future Plans** |\n",
            "| • **Radiation Protection** – ongoing research into dynamic shielding systems (e.g., superconducting magnetic fields). <br>• **Sustainability** – closed‑loop life support systems are being scaled; plans for a “bio‑sphere dome” to host indigenous flora. <br>• **Expansion** – a “South‑Pole Gateway” (SPG) is under construction to support future Mars missions. <br>• **Governance Reform** – proposals for a “Lunar Charter Amendment” to grant full self‑governance to Luna City by 2100. |\n",
            "| **Notable Residents** | • **Dr. Maya Chen** – planetary geologist who discovered a new class of lunar meteorites. <br>• **Commander Ryu Tanaka** – first civilian to command a lunar EVA mission. <br>• **Aisha Al‑Nasser** – the youngest elected council member (age 29). |\n",
