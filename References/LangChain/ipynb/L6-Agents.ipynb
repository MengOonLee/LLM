      "Summary: Ginevra King Pirie (November 30, 1898 – December 13, 1980) was an American socialite and heiress. As one of the self-proclaimed \"Big Four\" debutantes of Chicago during World War I, King inspired many characters in the novels and short stories of Jazz Age writer F. Scott Fitzgerald; in particular, the character of Daisy Buchanan in The Great Gatsby. A 16-year-old King met an 18-year-old Fitzgerald at a sledding party in Saint Paul, Minnesota, and they shared a passionate romance from 1915 to 1917.\n",
      "Although King was \"madly in love\" with Fitzgerald, their relationship ended when King's family intervened. Her father Charles Garfield King purportedly warned the young writer that \"poor boys shouldn't think of marrying rich girls\", and he forbade further courtship of his daughter. A heartbroken Fitzgerald dropped out of Princeton University and enlisted in the United States Army amid World War I. While courting his future wife Zelda Sayre and other young women when he was garrisoned near Montgomery, Alabama, Fitzgerald continued to write to King in the hope of rekindling their relationship.\n",
      "While Fitzgerald served in the army, King's father arranged her marriage to William \"Bill\" Mitchell [wd], the son of his wealthy business associate John J. Mitchell. An avid polo player, Bill Mitchell became the director of Texaco, and he served partly as a model for Thomas \"Tom\" Buchanan in The Great Gatsby. Despite King marrying Mitchell and Fitzgerald marrying Zelda Sayre, Fitzgerald remained in love with King until his death. Fitzgerald scholar Maureen Corrigan wrote that King, far more than the author's wife Zelda Sayre, became \"the love who lodged like an irritant in Fitzgerald's imagination, producing the literary pearl that is Daisy Buchanan\". In the mind of Fitzgerald, King was the prototype of the unobtainable, upper-class woman who embodies the elusive American Dream.\n",
      "During her relationship with Fitzgerald, Ginevra wrote a Gatsby-like story which she sent to the young author. In her story, she is trapped in a loveless marriage with a wealthy man yet still pines for Fitzgerald. The lovers are reunited only after Fitzgerald attains enough money to take her away from her adulterous husband. Fitzgerald kept Ginevra's story with him, and scholars have noted the plot similarities between Ginevra's story and Fitzgerald's novel.\n",
      "King separated from Mitchell in 1937 after an unhappy marriage. A year later, Fitzgerald attempted to reunite with King when she visited Hollywood. The reunion proved a disaster due to Fitzgerald's alcoholism. A disappointed King returned to Chicago and she divorced Mitchell in 1939. She married John T. Pirie Jr., a business tycoon and owner of the Chicago department retailer Carson Pirie Scott & Company in 1942. She died in 1980 at the age of 82 at her estate in Charleston, South Carolina.\n",

McConnell is in his seventh Senate term and is the longest-serving senator in Kentucky history.
