      "Question: If a plant doubles its size every day and covers a lake in 30 days, how long does it take for two plants to cover half the lake?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Let's think step by step. The plant doubles in size every day. So, on day 1, it's half the size of the lake. So, on day 2, it's double that, which is the entire lake. So, two plants would take 2 days to cover half the lake. But wait, that seems conflicting because if the single plant covers the lake in 30 days, two plants would take half that time, which is 15 days. So, I'm confused here. Maybe I got the math wrong. Let me try again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Okay, maybe I should model the growth of the plant. Let me define the lake's area as 1 unit. Then, the size of the plant on day n is 2^(n-1). So, on day 1, it's 1 unit, which is the size of the lake. Wait, no, that can't be right because if the plant doubles every day, it would be 2^(n-1) on day n, but if on day 30 it's covering the lake, then 2^(30-1) = 2^29 is the size of the plant on day 30. But that can't be because on day 1,\n"
