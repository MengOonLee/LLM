It provides a ready-made class that only requires the agents to manage, an LLM for the generating the text required for supervising the agents and responding to the user, and a `prompt` for dictating how to operate. Everything else, including a mechanism for building a conversation history, a function for deciding when to delegate a task, and more, are already coded into this class.\n\n`create_supervisor()` supports many parameters to modify its default behavior, but we'll only use two here:\n1. `add_handoff_back_messages`: additional messages indicating when a worker agent hands the task back to the supervisor.\n2. `output_mode`: controls how messages from worker agents are added to the conversation history of the system.","metadata":{},"id":"a4c5cad1-2415-45ae-9ea9-93002c7376a6","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"**Create a supervisor multi-agent that delegates tasks to the `research_agent` and `analyst_agent`.**","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f8177201-d090-44d3-a44b-a38ff32ccf69"},{"source":"from langgraph_supervisor import create_supervisor\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\n\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\", \"user_id\": \"1\"}}\ncheckpointer = InMemorySaver()\n\nsupervisor = ____(\n    model=llm,\n    agents=[____],\n    prompt=(\n        \"You are a supervisor managing two agents:\\n\"\n        \"- a research agent.

This is an extremely popular choice for multi-agent systems, and there isn't a limit to the number of supervisors you can have.\n\nYou can also begin to think about agents the same way that you would think about organizing a company, with different departments or business units, each unit with its own supervisor/manager, and teams within those units with their own team leads.\n\n![](images/multi_layer_supervisor.png)\n\n### ðŸ§  Some thoughts to finish on\n\n- **There's no once-size-fits-all approach to building multi-agent systems**: the best system design is highly use case-dependent, so study the needs closely, build, and test!\n- **Prompts are very important**: you may have seen while experimenting in this course, that you can connect all of the pieces together correctly, and still not get a performant system. Clear, instructive prompts are paramount for the agents to \"understand\" how to go about their tasks and collaborate with one another.\n- **LangGraph abstractions are there if you need them**: LangGraph prides itself on providing a low-level syntax, which gives more customizability than to about any other framework. Such low-level syntax isn't for the faint-hearted, so don't be afraid to lean on some of the pre-built functionality when you're building a first-attempt project&mdash;you can always reconfigure it during the experimentation phase if the need is there.","metadata":{},"id":"9c85909f-a245-4473-8937-39198f797940","cell_type":"markdown"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.12","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
